 - On the other hand, you could buy at $10 and loose money if the price falls to $1

Why do stock prices rise and fall:
 - If people want to buy, stock prices go up

Main Idea:
 - The 1930s Depression was worldwide
 - This caused people to look for alternitives to democracy
 - Extreme forums of nationalism arose in many countrys
 - NATIONALISM - The feeling that you country or culture is superiour to all others

Europe After WWI:
 - War Debts, the Depression, and the desstruction from the war lead to unstable governments in many countrys
 - Totalitarianism - In wich the government controls every aspect of Citizen's life

Totalitarianiam
 - Any forum of government that controls your life and can be called totalitaniam
 - Communism (Soviot Union) / Military Dictatorship (Japan) / Fascism (Germany and Italy)

The Soviot Union
 - Reminders
    - Russian Revolution - 1917 - Russia becomes a communist country.
    - New Name - Soviot Union (USSR)

Communism In Theroy:
 - Violent revolustion of the workers against the wealthy
 - Everyone shares property and wealth
 - Everyone is equal

Communism in reality:
 - Violent revolution and dictatorship
 - One person or party has complete control
 - The govrenment forces equality by owning all buisness and setting wages

Soviot Union:
 - In the late 1920s, the soviot leader Joseph Stalin industrialized (built facroties) the country, and forced farmers to give up their land to work on collectives - large government owned farms
 - Stalin closed places of workshop and had his politaital opponets (and uncopoperative farmers) killed.
    - Millions died

Japan:
 - Japan used military force to solve its economic problems
 - Japan's government was a military dictatorship
 - Japan's military leaders wanted to sieze new territories to take their natural resources
 - 1931 - Japan invaced Manchria, in northern China
 - The League of Nations and the U.S. critisized the invation, but no one wanted to go to war.

Italy
 - Because of a depressed economy and bitterness for WWI, many Italians looked for strong leadership, which they found in Benito Mussolini
 - Mussolini's government was baded on fascism - strong government headed by one individual
	- In fascism, the governemnt is seen as more importaint then individual citizens
	- Facism was anti-communist
	- Mussolini ruled Italy for over 20 years

Germany:
 - Adolf Hitler and his party, the National Socialists, or Nazis, seized power in 1932 and 1933. Hitler became a fascist dictator.
	- Reasons for Adolf Hitler's rise to power:
		1. Many Germants felt bitter about the outcome of WW1. The Treaty of Versailles required Germany to pay war reparations, accept blame for the war, lose territory, and limit the size of its army. Hitler promised revenge
		2. Reparations plus the Depression crippled the economy. Hitler promised improvement
		3. Hitler promised a new German Empire, (The Third Riech)
		4. Hitler offered Germans a scapegoat - someone to blame - for their problems. He blamed Jews for Germany's defeat and its post-war problems.
		5. Hitler built up German nationalism. He convinced citizens that the German race was superiour to all others, and Jews must be exterminated.
		6. Hitler = powerful public speaker. The nazis has effected propaganda

Germany
 - Government spending helped build Germany out of the depression
 - Hitler violated the Treaty of Versailles by rebuilding Germany's military.
 - 1936 - Germany and Italy formed a military alliance - the Axis Powers. Germany signed a similar alliance with Japan.

================================================
Five things learned from the film
1. September 1923 1st battle in poland
2. People thought the governemnt was to blame for the loss of WW1
3. Congress didnt want another war, so it didn't join wilson's world order league of nations
4. Street Battles kept popping up between communists and right winged people
5. Hitler actually wrote about the Jews in Mind Kamf, a book he wrote in prison

	 - Cambodia - 1970s
	 - Yugpslavia (Bosnia) - Early 1990s
	 - Rwanda - 1994
	 - Sudan - 2000s

Ani-Semitisim: Prejudicde or discrimination against Jerws
Hitler did not invent Anti-Semititm. It has existed in Europe (in some way) for hunderd of years
Jews were not 100% part of the culture and economy and Europe, but also faced prejudice for their differnet religious practices
Things that helped make the Holocaust possible:
	 - Racism and centuries-old Anti-Semitism in Europe
	 - Nationalism
	 - Germany's humilitation after WW1 and the desire for a scapegoat
	 - Lack of Cerncern for other countries
	 - Nazi propaganda
Early nazi actions against Jews
Soon after taking power, the Nazis wrtote laws that took away fro German Jews' civli rights, jobs, citizenship, money, education, and proverty.
Theese laws were passed from 1933-1941, and each one was more restrictive then the one before
1938: 32 countries in the Leagur of Naterions met to consider helping Jews who were fleeing the Nazis, but only the Dominican Republic was willing to accept them

GERMANY:
 - November 9, 1938 - Kristallnacht - the "night of broken glass"
 - Nazi mobs killed almost 100 Jews and seriouslu injered thousands more
 - More then 7,500 Jewish buisnesses, schools, and private homes were vandalized and demolished
 - 1,300 synagogues were burned
 - More then 30,000 Jewish boys and men were arrested and sent to concentration camps

In May, 10, 1933 in Berlin. Students led a book burning in a public square with books that were considered "un-German" which did not support their racist beliefs.

NAZI ACTIONS AGAINST JEWS
 - As the Nazis conquered nearby countries, millions of Jews came under their control.
 - The first people who went to Concentation Camps were political rivals
 - They were harsh prison work camps
 - In some cities, Germans forced Jews into isolated neighbothoods known as ghettos.
 - Also, specially-trained German soildures called Einsatgruppen killed large groups of Jews. These murders began in 1941
 - By 1941, the Nazis' goal had become Genocide.
	- The Nazis' planned to eliminate the Jews in specifically built Death Camps, which contained poisonous gas chambers and large furnaces
	- Healthy Kews were forced to work in camp factories

	- About 6 million Jews - 2/3 of all Jews living in pre-war Europe - perisned in the Holocause
 - The Nazis also targeted other minority groups:
	- Communists, Socialists, the handicapped, gypsies, Slavs, Soviot prisoners of war, Police intellectuals, and religious radicals
	- 10-11 million people died in total

Did anyone fight the Holocaust?
 - Yes, but the Resistance has limited impact. The Nazis were powerful and conquered many countries early in the war.
 - Those who resisted took huge riks; many lost their lives to save strangers. Couragrous!
 - Reasosn for resisiting varied. Some felt that there Christian faith has thought them differtne values. Some has known Jews as friends, so knew the Nazi propoganda was wrong.
 - Few considered themselves "heros".

Resistance: Individual Citizen
 - Acroos Europe, individual Citizens hid Jews in attics, cellars, and barns.
 - They shared limited food and supplies with those in hiding.
 - Many lied to the Nazis releatedly in order to protect the Jews.
 - Those who hid Jews faced penaltied from the Nazis, including death.
 - A famous example is Miep Gies, who hid teenager Anne Frank and her family. Anne Frank kept a diary of her life in hiding, which was published after the war.

Rescuer: Powerful individual 
 - Some people with offical status used their authority to save Jews.
 - They could provide fake passports and other documents, bribe Nazis, and use their influence to let Jews Escape.
 - Oskar Schindler was a German industrialist who employed Jews at his factories, which made military supportes for the Nazis.
 - He saved an extimated 1,100 Jews. 

Resistance: Uprising
 - In 1943, Jews in the Warsaw ghetto used homemade and smuggled weapons to resist a Nazi round-up.
 - Fighting continued for a month.
 - Nazis finally crushed the rebellion; 56,000 rounded up and sent to camps
 - Uprising sometimes happend at a concentration camps; none successful.

Orginized Resistance:
 - Throughout Europe, small groups of citizens fought the Nazis with gurrilla tactics.
 - Nanviolent: published anti-nazi newspapers, supplied fake documents, set up escape routes, spying for Allies.
 - Violent: homade bombs, isolated attacks on Nazi leaders
 - Larger groups hid in the dense forests of Europe
 - Most well known is the French Resistance or French Underground.

One nation resists:
 - Denmark was occupied by the Nazis
 - In 1943, leadership of Denmark learned that the Nazis planed to deport all 8,000 Jews in the country.
 - Danish people mobilized: in a 2-week period, about 7,220 Jews were taken by boat to safety in Swedan,
 - Hundreds of trips - each boat carried 12-20 passengers.
 - About 500 Danish Jews were deported by Germans, but most survived concentration camps
 - Unuque example of nationwide resistance

 - Hiding and helping Jews (Miep Gies - Helped Anne Frank's family)
 - Aiding Escape (Oskar Schindler - protected his Jewish employees)
 - Uprisings (Warsaw ghetto - fought back against the Nazis)
 - Orginised resistence (French - small attacks on Nazi troops)
 - National resistance (Denmark - the country worked together to save the Jews)

============== WWII - Conflict with Japan ==============
The two big questions: 
1. Why did Japan attack the United States?
2. How did the U.S. respond?

- US Neutrality - 
Although most Americans opposed Hitler, they did not want to fight in a European war, and the US remained neutral in the early stages of World War II
 - The US did sell weapons and offer loans to the Allies

- Imperial Japan -
After conquering much of China diring the 1930s, Japan desired the Southeast Asia and its valuable natural resources
 - Japan slowly expanded its empire, and built military bases on the islands and territors that it captured.
 - Prevented them from buying products critical to Japanese industry, such as oil and steel.
 - Froze Japanese accounts in US banks
 - Moved the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii
	 - Japan wanted the control the Pacific, and felt the only way to do so was to cripple the American fleet at Pearl Harbot.

- Pearl Harbor - 
On Dec 7, 1941, Japanese warplanes attacked Pearl Harbor
	 - 9 ships sunk, 13 others damaged.
	 - 188 planes dystroyed
	 - 1400 Americans died
Although ths US was expecting war with Japan in the future, Pearl Harbor was unprepared for the suprise attack.
America was outraged, and, the next day, FDR asked Congress to declare war on Japan
 - Germany then declared war on the US

- Internment -
Wartime anger after Pearl Harbor led to widespread discrimination against Japanese Americans.
	 - In 1941, more then 125,000 Japanese Americans lived in the United States, mostly on the West Coast.
	 - Most were US citizens born to Japanese immigrants
Fearing the possibility of spying or sabotage, in Feb 1942, the US government began a process of internment, or forced relocation and imprisonment
	 - Most Japanese Americans were moved to remote camps
	 - They lost their rights and freedoms, had to give up their homes and buisnesses, and suffered long-lasting humiliation

- D-Day -
While soviot forces pushed hitler out of the USSE in 1943, the Allies planned an invasion of German-occupied france.
 - The plan called fro troops to land on the beaches of Normandy, in northern France.
 - On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 150,000 Allied soildures swarmed ashore
 - It was the largest sea-and-land invasion in history.
 - After the D-Day, the Alles were able to push the Germans back, and France was liberated in August

- Victory in Europe -
The allies bombed Germany heavity during the final months of WWII, and early in 1945, they continued to advance towards belin
 - Some allied leaders thought it was importaint for noncommunist Allies to occupy as much of Germany as possible, to keep it out of Soviot hands
 - Allied troops, weapons, supplies, and leadership were too much for Germany to overcome.
 - May 7, 1945 - Germany surrendered

- President Truman -
On april 12, 1945, President Roosevelt died. Harry S. Truman became president

- The Pacific -
1945 - Even after much of Tokyo was destroyed by Allied bombing, Japan refused to surrender
 - In fact, the US encountered some of the biercest fighting of the War as they got closer to Japan.
 - Japan used the desperate tactic of kamikaze - crasting piloted planes into Allied ships
