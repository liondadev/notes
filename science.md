# IE 2.1 Earthquakes and Seismic Waves

## Slide 1 - What is an earthquake
1. Movement of rock
2. 100km
3. focus
4. epicenter

## Slide 2 - Types of Seismic Waves
1. energy
2. focus
3. primary
4. if there is a number 4 => on

## Slide 3 - Body Waves
1. P waves
2. compressional
3. S Waves
4. slower
5. solids
6. up and down

## Slide 4 - Surface Waves
1. Slower
2. Rayleigh Waves

## Slide 5 - Measuring Earthquakes
1. 20
2. Mercali
3. Richter
4. moment magnitude

## Slide 6 - Mercalli Scale
1. level of damage
2. subjective

## Slide 7 - Richter Scale (1930s)
1. magnitude
2. Seisemic
3. seismograph

## Slide 8 - Why the Richter Sclae is better
1. mathmatical measurments
2. On peoples perception and experience

## Slide 9 - Moment Magnitude Scale (1970s) is the best
1. total energy
2. all sizes
3. how much movement of rock

# Main Ideas

## IE 2.2 Main Ideas
1. The focus is the area where rocks start to break
2. An earthquake is caused by seisemic waves
3. There are two types of waves, Primary waves and S or secondary waves
4. Primary and Secondary waves are in a catgegory called Surface Waves

# Categories of Seismic Waves

## Surface Waves
Rayleigh Waves
Love Waves

## Body Waves
Primary Waves (P Waves)
Secondary Waves (S Waves)
