# Finding Area
Calculate how big an object is

## Find the area of a box
Area = l * w

## Find the area of a triangle
Area = (l * w) / 2

# Finding the base of an object
Allows you do calculate area

## Funding base of box
Always the bottom, as long as it could stand up

## Finding the base of a triangle
The side on which the trangle could stand on its own

# Handouts / Homework
Homework and other handouts

## Chapter 6 (Finding area handouts)
1. 10 x 8 = 80 / 2 = 40
2. 9 x 12 = 110 = 55

# Whiteboard Practice

## 2/18/2021
1. Area = 8 * 10 / 2 = 40
2. Area = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21
3. Area = 4 * 6 / 2 = 12

## Composite Shapes
1. Cut them into smaller shapes
2. find a label missing lengths using CLUES, not "it looks like" (use the vertical lines to find missing vertical lines, use horizontal for horizontal)
3. User perimiter by adding all outer shapes (no dotted lines)
